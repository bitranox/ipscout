# New public Python library (from the bitranox template)

## Overview

Do not hand-build a new public Python library. Clone the template
`lib_ping` (https://github.com/bitranox/lib_ping),
rename it to your package, and you inherit a working layout, strict typing, a
CLI, and a full CI/test/release pipeline. This skill is the scaffold-install-use
sequence plus the pitfalls that a from-memory guess gets wrong.

## When to use

- Starting any new public bitranox Python library (a reusable package, optionally
  with a registered CLI command).
- Installing or using a library that was built from this template.

Not for: an application/service (use the app template), or a one-off script.

## 1. Scaffold the repo

The rename is driven by the **directory name**, so name the new directory for your package
first. Copy the template, detach the template remote, rename, then reset the history.

```bash
# copy the template into a new dir named for your package
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bitranox/lib_ping.git lib_wombat
cd lib_wombat
git remote remove origin         # detach from the template so nothing pushes back to it
git branch -m master main        # NEW repos use main, never master
git config core.fileMode false   # softdev mount: manage exec bits explicitly

./rename_dry.sh    # PREVIEW: rename-project --dry-run. Confirm the detected name/paths
                   # read "lib_wombat" everywhere before applying.
./rename.sh        # APPLY: rename-project --yes. Takes NO argument - the new name comes
                   # from the directory, so `./rename.sh lib_wombat` does nothing.
./reset_git_history.sh   # squash the template history into one fresh commit
```

`rename.sh` / `rename_dry.sh` run `rename-project` from
`git+https://github.com/bitranox/rename_project.git` via `uvx`. **`reset_git_history.sh`
force-pushes to the first remote it finds**, so detach the template `origin` first (above) or
it rewrites the template's own history; with no remote it rewrites local history only. Add
your own empty repo as `origin` and push `main` afterwards.

## 2. Install

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"               # editable, with the dev toolchain
```

For installing a FINISHED library (as a user): `uv pip install <name>`, or
`uv tool install <name>` for the CLI, or `uvx <name>` to run without installing.

## 3. Use the result

The template ships a rich-click CLI (two console commands plus `python -m <pkg>`)
and a small library API. Replace the placeholder behaviors with your own.

```bash
<pkg> info      # print resolved package metadata
<pkg> hello     # placeholder success path
<pkg> --help
```

```python
import <pkg> as lib
lib.emit_greeting()     # placeholder; swap for your real API
```

## 4. Develop and release (bmk)

The `Makefile` is a thin bmk wrapper - do not edit it. Trailing args are forwarded;
`make help` lists everything.

```bash
make test                         # lint + pyright + import-linter + bandit + pip-audit + pytest
make push MSG="feat: ..."         # test, commit, push (MSG= is the safe channel)
make bump-patch                   # bump X.Y.(Z+1); also bump-minor / bump-major
make release                      # tag + GitHub release; CI publishes to PyPI
```

CI, the PyPI publish workflow, and CodeQL come from `.github/`, managed by the
`default_cicd_public` template. Never hand-edit `.github/*`. To publish to PyPI, add a
Trusted Publisher on PyPI (owner, repo, workflow `default_release_public.yml`,
environment `pypi`) or set the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret.

## If the new repo also ships a skill, it is a marketplace

A repo that ships a Claude Code skill (a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` plus
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`) is a plugin marketplace. Two
consequences that a plain library does not have:

- **Protect its default branch on GitHub** (block force-push and deletion, enforce on
  admins). A published marketplace that gets force-pushed silently freezes every install
  (`/plugin marketplace update` is a `git pull` that can no longer fast-forward).
- **Bump the plugin version on every skill change** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  semver). Installs only re-fetch on a version change. Keep history append-only; never
  squash or force-push a published marketplace.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                                              | Fix                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./rename.sh lib_wombat` (passing the name as arg)   | Name the DIRECTORY; run `./rename.sh` with no arg.                     |
| Skipping `./rename_dry.sh`                           | Always preview first; the dry-run is the safety check.                 |
| `reset_git_history.sh` with the template as `origin` | It force-pushes to the first remote; `git remote remove origin` first. |
| Keeping the `master` branch                          | New repos use `main` (`git branch -m master main`).                    |
| Editing `.github/*`                                  | Template-managed; change CI in `default_cicd_public` instead.          |
| Hand-editing the `Makefile` or version in code       | Makefile is bmk-generated; bump only `pyproject.toml`.                 |

## Reference

The template's docs go deeper - open them on the default branch (latest) under
`https://github.com/bitranox/lib_ping/blob/master/docs/`: `installation.md`,
`usage.md`, `development.md`, and the `systemdesign/` reference. A repo you generate from the template
carries these same files locally, so inside your new project the plain `docs/...` paths resolve.
